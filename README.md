# Description
Ubuntu 20.04 is used as our build-environment, either installed natively on a machine or via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

# Installation
For initial setup of the development environment on your machine:

1. Install Ubuntu 20.04, either natively or in WSL. If you're planning on using MATLAB Simulink, I recommend using WSL1.

2. Download or clone this repository, navigate to it in your terminal and run *bootstrap.sh* with *sudo* permissions.
